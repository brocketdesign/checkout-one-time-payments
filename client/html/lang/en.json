      "question": "What video formats do you support?",
      "answer": "We support all major video formats including MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, and more. If you have a particular format need, please contact our support team. Our system is designed to be compatible with virtually any standard video format you might encounter, making it easy to use without worrying about technical details or conversions. For optimal processing speed, we recommend using MP4 files encoded with H.264, but this is not a requirement."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How quickly will my video be processed?",
      "answer": "Processing time depends on video length and complexity, but most videos under 5 minutes are completed within 10-15 minutes. Our system uses parallel processing techniques to maximize efficiency for all users. Longer videos or those with multiple faces may take additional time to ensure quality results. Pro and Enterprise users receive priority in our processing queue, which can significantly reduce waiting times during peak periods. You'll receive a notification as soon as your video is ready for download."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Is my data secure and private?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We use bank-level encryption for all uploads and automatically delete your files after processing is complete and a brief retention period (typically 24 hours). Our privacy policy strictly prohibits using customer content for AI training or sharing with third parties. We maintain SOC 2 compliance and regular security audits to ensure your data remains protected. All processing happens on secure isolated servers, and access to processing systems is strictly limited to essential personnel only."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can I swap multiple faces in one video?",
      "answer": "Currently, we process one face swap per video for optimal quality and accuracy. This allows our AI to focus entirely on creating the most realistic and seamless integration possible. If you need multiple faces swapped, we recommend processing the video multiple times in sequence, swapping one face at a time. For Enterprise clients with specific multi-face swap requirements, we can develop custom solutions to handle more complex scenarios. Contact our sales team to discuss your specific needs."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the results?",
      "answer": "Customer satisfaction is our priority. If you're not happy with your face swap, please contact our support team within 7 days of processing, and we'll work with you to improve the results or provide a refund. We might ask for specific feedback to help us understand what aspects didn't meet your expectations, which helps us continuously improve our technology. In many cases, simply providing a different photo or adjusting certain parameters can dramatically improve results on a second attempt."
